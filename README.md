# backgrounder

A little NodeJS thing I threw together so I can reliably get random wallpapers for my homepage.

## Requirements

- Node
  - Tested with `v20.17.0`
- Any of the Node Package Managers

## Usage

- Download the repo using `git clone https://github.com/dynamyc010/backgrounder.git`
- Add your backgrounds into `./backgrounds`
- Download`node_modules` however you feel like doing it.
  - `npm i` is probably the easiest.
- Use the Docker Compose file, or just run `npm start` to run locally.

## Environment Variables

| Name   | Default |
| ------ | -------- |
| `PORT` | `3000`   |
